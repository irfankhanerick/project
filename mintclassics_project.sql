1.	Build the following queries: 
i.	Find the total order amount for each order that has not shipped (i.e., any status value other than ‘shipped’).  Return the columns in the screenshot shown below. 
Hint: Result has 23 rows. Use an aggregate function in SELECT clause to sum up the priceEach multiplied by quantityOrdered, join the orders and orderDetails tables, and GROUP by customerNumber, orderNumber and status.
ii.	Using the query above, get the average order amount for all customer orders that have not shipped.  
Hint: average of all orders that have not shipped should be 32134.61
iii.	 Return the customer orders that have not shipped and have a larger than the average order amount for all orders that have not shipped.  Return columns as shown in the screenshot below sorted by orderAmount in descending order.  
Hint: Result has 12 rows. Use the answer to part ii as a subquery in the HAVING clause of an outer query that is similar to your answer for part i with one more join on customers to pick up the customer name which replaces customerNumber.
